Then checking for a word is super easy as you just need to check if there is a node that exists at word. |
| Sep 23 | 20:40 - 21:10 | Could not find any (significant) optimizations for graph, so I decided to look for alternative solutions. I already knew about HashMap in Java (how it works and why its performance is so good), and was wondering if they had any similarly performant classes which could be good for this scenario and found HashSet and LinkedHashSet (yay don't have to make my own HashMap based classes!), which would allow me to have constant time lookups for all of the words, and an O(dictionarySize) time for registering all the words. Essentially every time I add/search for a word, it gets a hash from the word. This hash serves essentially as an index to a list, allowing it to perform constant time lookups rather than having to look through the entire list! |
